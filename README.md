## Random Walks And Phonetic Drift
A program designed to check the statistical difference between languages, and use random walks to model shifts in their phonetics.

# Overall Design:
Program does a statistical analysis on different spoken languages to tell the difference between them. This is based on a model where vowels shift along a graph data-set, and consonants can move between vocalization placement but not their manner of articulation (i.e. plosive, nasal, etc.) this information can be more easily visualized with the graphs available at www.internationalphoneticassosciation.org
